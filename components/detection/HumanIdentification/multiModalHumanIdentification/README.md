# multiModalHumanIdentification / Late Fusion
![Multi-Modal Human Indetification Image](../docs/images/Heirarical.png)



> This component will makes a call to different components, combine their features and search the database/gallery to identify the person. If no person is identified then the data is added to the gallery as a new person.

## Description
 



This component has 3 tasks: 

- **Combining features** 
    Similar to the [Violaâ€“Jones](!https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/courses/LBMV07/Papers/viola-cvpr-01.pdf) object detection framework. We can sort each method by their computation time. For each module if the module is able to identify the person then that id is returned, else the next module is called. This module also has to take account of missing features and noisy features. 

- **Perform kNN on the gallery/database**
    After creating the final feature representation,kNN is performed on the whole database. Mode of candidates identified  is returned as output. 

- **Adding/Deleting samples in the database**

## How To Use

#### Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Starting component
For each module open a new terminal(Crtl-Alt-T)  
```
cd $HOME/robocomp-aston/components/detection/HumanIdentification/multiModalHumanIdentification
cmake . 
make
cp etc/config etc/config-run
```
*To avoid changing the **config** file in the repository, we can copy it to **config-new** in the component's home directory, so changes will remain untouched by future git pulls.*

After editing the new config file we can run each component
```
python3 src/multiModalHumanIdentification.py 
```

*By default --human_reid_threshold = 10, --face_recognition_threshold = 0.55,  --gait_recognition_threshold = 0.1. See [opt](./src/multiModalHumanIdentification.py) to see parameters for the module*
